# openEO Hub

This repository contains the source code for [openEO Hub](http://hub.openeo.org), a centralized platform to explore openEO back-end providers.

openEO Hub tries to implement some ambitious ideas. The idea is to be a platform that may allow users to:

* find back-ends by data sets
* find back-ends supporting required processes, e.g. by submitting a process graph and checking automatically against all back-ends
* find back-ends that support UDFs
* get information about back-ends, e.g. regarding costs
* explore publicly available pre-defined proceses graphs
* explore publicly available containers to run UDFs
