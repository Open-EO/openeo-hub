		<p><strong>openEO hub</strong> is a tool to discover services that support the openEO API. It is also an exchange platform to share process graphs among the openEO community.</p>
		<p>The data is crawled from the services and then cached, so may lag behind reality.</p>
		<p>For more information on openEO, visit the project's homepage: <a href="https://openeo.org/">https://openeo.org/</a></p>
		<p>The source code of this website is available <a href="https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-hub">on GitHub</a>.</p>
		<p>If you want to add a service to this index, please open a pull request on GitHub that edits <a href="https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-hub/blob/master/config.json">the config.json file</a> accordingly. We will then review and merge it and after a quick redeployment the crawler will index your service too. Any newcomers are very welcome!</p>
